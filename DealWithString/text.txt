GNU is a Unix-like operating system. 
That means it is a collection of many programs: 
applications, libraries, developer tools, even games. 
The development of GNU, started in January 1984, 
is known as the GNU Project. 
Many of the programs in GNU are released 
under the auspices of the GNU Project; 
those we call GNU packages. 

The name "GNU" is a recursive acronym 
for "GNU's Not Unix." 
"GNU" is pronounced g'noo, as one syllable, 
like saying "grew" but replacing the r with n.
